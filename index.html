    RealityCheckBot (“we”, “our”, or “the bot”) is a conversational analysis bot
    available on platforms such as Telegram and Instagram. Our goal is to provide
    educational analysis and reality checks on money-making claims shared by users.

  <ul>
    <li>Message content voluntarily sent by users (text or links)</li>

    <li>Payment information</li>
    <li>Location data</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
  <p>
    User messages are used solely to analyze money-making claims and generate
    an educational “reality check” response.

  <p>
    Messages may be temporarily processed by third-party AI services (such as OpenAI)
    strictly for analysis purposes.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>We do not permanently store user messages</li>
    <li>We do not maintain user profiles</li>
    <li>Messages are processed in real-time and discarded</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    We use third-party APIs to analyze content, including AI language models.
    These services process data in accordance with their own privacy policies.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>
    We do not sell, rent, or share user data with advertisers or other third parties.
  </p>

  <h2>6. User Consent</h2>
  <p>
    By sending a message to RealityCheckBot, you consent to the processing of your
    message for analysis and to receiving an automated educational response.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Educational Disclaimer</h2>
